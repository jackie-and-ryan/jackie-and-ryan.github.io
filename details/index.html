        <h1>Details and Travel</h1>
        
        <h2>Flights and Cars</h2>
        <p>Our wedding venue is roughly 20 minutes north of San Francisco (SFO) airport, which is the best access point for our wedding. However, Oakland (OAK) isn't too far if you're willing to brave occasional bridge traffic. Both airports have car rental facilities on site.</p>

        <h2>Hotel</h2>
        <p>We currently have a room block at the Marriott Courtyard San Francisco located at 299 2nd Street San Francisco. The wedding rate is $199 per night for Friday and Saturday. We've heard that some people are unable to book the rate when you call them directly. You can book using <a href="http://www.marriott.com/meeting-event-hotels/group-corporate-travel/groupCorp.mi?resLinkData=Rogers/Borker%20Wedding%5Esfocd%60rbwrbwa%60199.00%60USD%60false%604%607/7/17%607/9/17%606/17/17&app=resvlink&stop_mobi=yes"> this link </a>. We've had less luck calling the hotel, but if you prefer to do it that way, you may call the hotel directly at 415-947-0700 and mention the Rogers / Borker wedding to get the rate. If you have any issues, please <a href="mailto:hello@jackieandryan.com">contact us!</a></p>

        <h2> Tranportation in SF </h2>
        <p> As the birthplace of Lyft and Uber, you'll find both apps easy and convenient to use. Go to the app store on your phone and download the apps - they'll make it easy to get around. SFO to the hotel will be ~$25-$35 depending on the time of day. It's also the easiest way between the venue, welcome drinks, and the hotel. Each way should be $5-$10, less if you ride with others!

        Public Transportation is also accessible to the Pearl, if you take the above ground rail down Third Street after walking from the hotel.

        Finally, you could rent a car, however, we expect parking to be a nightmare for you. Split a Lyft instead!
