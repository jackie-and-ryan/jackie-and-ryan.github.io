        <h1>Details and Travel</h1>
        
        <h2>Flights and Cars</h2>
        <p>Our wedding venue is roughly 20 minutes north of San Francisco (SFO) airport, which is the best access point for our wedding. However, Oakland (OAK) isn't too far if you're willing to brave occasional bridge traffic. Both airports have car rental facilities on site.</p>

        <h2>Hotel</h2>
        <p>We currently have a room block at the Marriott Courtyard San Francisco located at 299 2nd Street San Francisco. The wedding rate is $199 per night for Friday and Saturday. We've heard that some people are unable to book the rate when you call them directly. You can book using [this link](http://www.marriott.com/meeting-event-hotels/group-corporate-travel/groupCorp.mi?resLinkData=Rogers/Borker%20Wedding%5Esfocd%60rbwrbwa%60199.00%60USD%60false%604%607/7/17%607/9/17%606/17/17&app=resvlink&stop_mobi=yes). We've had less luck calling the hotel, but if you prefer to do it that way, you may call the hotel directly at 415-947-0700 and mention the 'Rogers / Borker' wedding to get the rate. If you have any issues, please [contact us!](mailto:hello@jackieandryan.com)</p>
