## We're close to the day

It's less than 2 weeks away, and we're so excited and grateful that people from all corners of the globe will be coming to celebrate with us!

Our house feels less like a home than a warehouse for wedding decorations, supplies, and all sorts of other goodies we can't wait to share with you. 

We've run into a couple of hiccups, including running out of rooms at the Marriott, but if you have any questions or concerns, you can always write us directly.

## Updates + Things to do

In the days to come, we'll be updating our site with some of our favorite things to do in SF. You should absolutely take advantage of all of the historic and exciting things SF has to offer. We'll be updating the Getting Here tab with all sorts of fun things to do in the upcoming days.

## Getting around

One last note - we encourage everyone to use Uber / Lyft to get around. Uber's been taking a beating these days, but it still works. For those of you who prefer your companies to have a conscience, Lyft is also good. 

## Celebrating together

We're finally excited for all of our disparate friend groups and family come together. Everyone coming is awesome. So we encourage everyone to meet a couple new people and maybe make a couple new friends.

We can't wait to celebrate with all of you!!
