                    <p>We met in Boston and our first date was a picnic. Ryan tried to cook and brought Zojirushi's (ie Japanese Thermoses) of wine. Jackie thought Ryan looked like a dork with a cooler but rolled with it anyway. We've experienced beach, mountain and forests across many countries. We staged surprise birthday parties one day after each other. There have been fake murders, real sharks, quiet afternoons, and a fair bit of whiskey. We'll get married a week before the 3rd anniversary of our 1st date.</p>
